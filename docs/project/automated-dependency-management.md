# Automated Dependency Management Workflow

**Last updated:** July 2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

This document describes the fully automated, robust dependency update workflow for Orson Vision, powered by Renovate and GitHub Actions. It covers setup, PR review, CI/CD integration, notifications, and best practices for safe, rapid, and hands-off dependency management.

---

## 1. Renovate Setup

- **Install the [Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate)** and grant access to the Orson Vision repository.
- Renovate will scan dependencies and open PRs for updates, grouped and labeled according to `.github/renovate.json`.

---

## 2. PR Review Process

- **Patch updates:** Automerged if all checks pass.
- **Minor/Major/Security updates:** Require manual review.
- PRs include:
  - Changelogs and release notes
  - Breaking change warnings
  - Security vulnerability info
- Review PR body for details and mitigation steps.
- Run `npm run quality-gate` locally for extra assurance.

---

## 3. CI/CD Integration

- Every Renovate PR triggers the `quality-gate.yml` workflow:
  - Linting
  - Type-checking
  - Formatting
  - Unit/integration tests
  - Security audit
  - Docs and CSS validation
- PRs are only merged if all checks pass.

---

## 4. Notifications

- Enable GitHub notifications for PRs/issues.
- (Optional) Integrate Slack/Teams for critical PR alerts using GitHub webhooks or third-party bots.

---

## 5. Redundancy (Optional)

- You may add a `.github/dependabot.yml` for backup, but Renovate is the primary tool.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Group updates by type (patch, minor, major) and ecosystem.
- Schedule updates for off-peak hours.
- Review major/breaking/security PRs carefully.
- Keep the `quality-gate` script robust and fast.
- Document this workflow for onboarding.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If a PR fails checks, review logs and changelogs for breaking changes.
- For complex upgrades, test locally before merging.
