## 🎨 DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### **Visual Identity**
- **Primary Blue (Dark Blue)**: `#111827` to `#1e3a8a` (Trust, Professionalism, Reliability)
  - *Hex Code*: `#111827` (for text) or `#1e3a8a` (for solid backgrounds)
  - *Meaning*: Represents trust, professionalism, reliability, stability, and hints at the digital realm
  - *Application*: Dominant color for backgrounds, primary text, structural elements (e.g., website headers, navigation)
- **Accent Orange (Gold)**: `#F59E0B` to `#FBBF24` (Creativity, Innovation, Warmth)
  - *Hex Code*: `#F59E0B` or `#FBBF24`
  - *Meaning*: Symbolizes creativity, innovation, warmth, premium quality, and directly ties into the "cinematic" aspect, reminiscent of a golden hour glow or an award
  - *Application*: Used for highlights, call-to-action elements, interactive components, secondary text, and visual accents
- **Supporting Neutrals**: Maintain existing supporting neutrals for light and dark modes, ensuring readability and harmony
- **Typography**: Geist Sans (Modern, Clean, Readable)
- **Animations**: Smooth, purposeful, performance-optimized
- **Theme Support**: Full dark and light mode with adaptive color schemes

### **Logo Iconography & Brand Elements**
- **"O" in Orson**: The stylized camera lens or focus ring within the letter "O" in "ORSON" is a key visual element that reinforces the "Vision" aspect, the cinematic connection, and precision. This element should be referenced when discussing brand elements and visual identity.
- **Play Button Triangle**: The triangular play button icon containing a circular element (eye/lens) on the right side of "ORSON" is crucial. This directly symbolizes video, motion, and cinematic output. The internal circular element (eye/lens) within the play button further emphasizes "Vision" and focus. This element's color (the blue outer triangle and the orange inner circle) should be consistently referenced using the adapted palette.
- **Symbolism**: These logo elements embody the brand's core values of "Cinematic Humanism" and "Digital Innovation," creating a visual language that speaks to both the technical expertise and the human-centered approach.

### **User Experience**
- **Mobile-First**: Every interaction designed for mobile
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in both themes
- **Performance**: 95+ Lighthouse scores
