# AI Quality Enforcement Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy to ensure all future AI-generated code consistently meets the project's high quality standards across linting, formatting, TypeScript, security, performance, testing, documentation, and Git hygiene.

## 1. Internalized Project Rules

### Quality Standards Memory

The AI now internalizes all project-specific rules:

- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, 'I' prefix for interfaces
- **Import Organization**: Built-in â†’ External â†’ Internal â†’ Relative
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance, explicit typing, no implicit any
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library, 90%+ coverage, proper mocking
- **Documentation**: All docs in `docs/` folder, kebab-case naming
- **Security**: No eval(), input validation, XSS prevention
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis, Lighthouse compliance
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation

### Automatic Rule Application

Every code generation request will automatically:

- Apply ESLint rules from `.eslintrc.json`
- Follow Prettier formatting from `.prettierrc`
- Use TypeScript strict mode from `tsconfig.json`
- Create/update corresponding test files
- Update relevant documentation

## 2. Pre-Generation Quality Gates

### Prompt Engineering

All code generation prompts will include:

- Explicit quality requirements
- Test synchronization requirements
- Documentation update requirements
- Security and accessibility standards

### Template-Driven Output

- Use project-specific component templates
- Follow established patterns for utilities and APIs
- Maintain consistent file structure and naming

## 3. Automated Post-Generation Validation

### Immediate Quality Checks

After generating any code, automatically run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run format:check
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Synchronization

- Ensure every component has a corresponding test file
- Update existing tests when components change
- Maintain proper mocking patterns
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage

### Security and Performance Scans

- Check for forbidden patterns (eval, innerHTML, etc.)
- Validate input sanitization
- Monitor bundle size and performance metrics

## 4. Autonomous Remediation

### Auto-Fix Capabilities

- Fix linting errors automatically
- Resolve TypeScript type issues
- Apply Prettier formatting
- Update test files to match new implementations

### Learning from Corrections

- Store correction patterns in memory
- Update internal rules based on user feedback
- Prevent recurrence of common violations

## 5. Documentation and Transparency

### Automatic Documentation Updates

- Update API documentation for new components
- Create changelog entries for new features
- Update technical documentation as needed

### Audit Trail

- Log all AI-generated code changes
- Track quality check results
- Maintain history of remediations

## 6. Workflow Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Enforce all quality gates before commit
- Prevent commits with lint/type errors
- Ensure test coverage requirements

### IDE Integration

- Provide real-time quality feedback
- Suggest fixes for violations
- Auto-format on save

## 7. Continuous Improvement

### Periodic Quality Audits

- Run comprehensive quality analysis monthly
- Review and update standards based on findings
- Refine AI generation patterns

### Feedback Loop

- Learn from successful and failed generations
- Update templates and rules based on patterns
- Improve accuracy over time

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. Use natural language prompts for feature requests
2. AI will automatically apply all quality standards
3. Review generated code and tests before committing
4. Provide feedback to improve future generations

### For AI Assistant

1. Always apply project quality standards
2. Create/update tests for all code changes
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Run quality checks before presenting code
5. Learn from user corrections and feedback

## Success Metrics

- **Quality Compliance**: 100% of AI-generated code passes all checks
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage for all generated components
- **Documentation**: All new features properly documented
- **Security**: Zero security violations in generated code
- **Performance**: All code meets performance benchmarks
